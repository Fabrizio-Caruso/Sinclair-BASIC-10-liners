Details
-------
ZXText2P takes a plain text file containing a ZX81 BASIC program as
input and turns it into .p file suitable for use with an emulator or
for transfer to a real ZX81.

In addition to standard line-numbered input, you may optionally also
use label-based program code. See the documentation in the "doc\"
folder for full usage information.
